# Influencer Marketing Dashboard

This is a **Streamlit-based dashboard** designed to track and analyze the performance of **influencer marketing campaigns**. The dashboard integrates with a MySQL database to provide insights into campaign performance, influencer ROI, incremental ROAS (Return on Ad Spend), and detailed payout tracking.

It allows marketing teams to analyze influencer impact, measure campaign success, and track the return on investments from influencer collaborations.

## **Objective of the Dashboard**

The purpose of this dashboard is to track, visualize, and provide actionable insights into influencer marketing campaigns. By integrating influencer data, post performance, and payouts, the dashboard helps brands and marketers to:
- **Measure campaign performance** by tracking metrics like revenue, cost, and orders.
- **Evaluate ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)** to understand the profitability of each campaign.
- **Track incremental ROAS** to see how each influencer contributes to total campaign revenue.
- **Identify top-performing influencers** and brands with the best return on investment.
- **Track influencer payouts** based on performance metrics.

## **Features**
